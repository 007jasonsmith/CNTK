     # running on every BVT job in 'S' (Speech) leg in Debug-GPU and Release-CPU configurations:
     # TODO: We do not run the test in the Windows GPU debug mode due to different baselines on dphaim and cntk-muc
     - bvt-s  (build_sku == 'gpu') and (os!='windows' or flavor!='debug') and ((flavor=='debug') ^ (device=='cpu'))
     # running unconditionally on every Nightly job in 'S' leg
     # TODO Windows Debug on GPU is flaky (depending on hardware?)

testCases:
  CNTK Run must be completed:
    patterns:
      - __COMPLETED__

  Epochs must be finished with expected results:
    patterns:
      - Finished Epoch[{{integer}} of {{integer}}]
      - CrossEntropyWithSoftmax = {{float,tolerance=.1%}}
      - EvalClassificationError = {{float,tolerance=.1%}}
      - learningRatePerSample = {{float,tolerance=0.001%}}
