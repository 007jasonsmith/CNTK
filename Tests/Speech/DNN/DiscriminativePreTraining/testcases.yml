     # running on every BVT job in 'S' (Speech) leg in Debug-GPU and Release-CPU configurations:

     # TODO: Temporary disabling Release-GPU because of a known bug causing large variance between
     # Release and Debug configurations for GPU only for this (Speech/DNN/DiscriminativePreTraining) test. 
     # This will be re-enabled after the bug has been addressed.

     - nightly-s  (flavor!='release') or (device!='gpu')

testCases:
  CNTK Run must be completed:
    patterns:
      - ^COMPLETED

  Must train epochs in exactly same order and parameters:
    patterns:
      - ^Starting Epoch {{integer}}
      - learning rate per sample = {{float}}
      - momentum = {{float}}

  Epochs must be finished with expected results:
    patterns:
      - ^Finished Epoch[{{integer}} of {{integer}}]
      - TrainLossPerSample = {{float,tolerance=.1%}}
      - EvalErrPerSample = {{float,tolerance=.25%}}
      - Ave LearnRatePerSample = {{float,tolerance=0%}}

  Per-minibatch training results must match:
    patterns:
      - ^ Epoch[{{integer}} of {{integer}}]-Minibatch[{{integer}}-{{integer}} of {{integer}}]
      - SamplesSeen = {{integer}}
      - TrainLossPerSample = {{float,tolerance=.2%}}
