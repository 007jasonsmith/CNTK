# Eval Client
This folder contains the VC++ project file to build CPPEvalClient.
This project creates CPPEvalClient.exe in the directory $(SolutionDir)..\..\x64\CPPEvalClient.Release. The CPPEvalClient only supports 64-bit target and release configuration. 
Before start the example, please make sure that the directory containing CNTK dependent dlls, usually $(SolutionDir)..\..\cntk\, is specified as a part of the PATH environment variable.
