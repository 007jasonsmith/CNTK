# CNTK Demos and Example Setups

This folder contains examples that correspond to popular data sets and tasks. 
These data sets often require a license and are therefore not included in the repository. 
The 'Demos' folder contains a few self-contained and documented demos to get started with CNTK.

The four examples shown in the table below provide a good introduction to CNTK.
